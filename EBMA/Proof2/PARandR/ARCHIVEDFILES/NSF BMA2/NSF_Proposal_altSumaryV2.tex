\section*{Project Summary}

\thispagestyle{empty}

In order to facilitate better scientific modeling of social phenomena
(e.g., election outcomes or domestic crises), we propose to extend a
promising statistical method and to develop software that will aid
scholars across disciplines to make more accurate forecasts of future
events.  This project builds on work in the fields of meteorology and
statistics to (1) extend the method for application to a wider array
of outcomes (e.g., binary data), (2) provide freely available software
that implements both maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation
techniques, and (3) provide accessible explanations of the method and
social science applications.

Ensemble Bayesian model averaging (EBMA) improves prediction by
pooling \emph{all} information from multiple forecasting models to
generate ensemble predictions similar to a weighted average of
component forecasts.  The weight assigned each forecast is based on
its predictive accuracy and precision.  Thus, EBMA differs from prior
work in the social sciences that relies on simple averages of
component forecasts and neither calibrates weights based on model
performance nor accounts for predictive uncertainty.

The aim of EBMA is not to choose some ``best'' model, but rather to
incorporate the insights and knowledge implicit in various forecasting
efforts via statistical post-processing.  These component models can
be diverse and need not share covariates, functional forms, or error
structures. Indeed, the components may not even be statistical models,
but may be predictions generated by agent-based models or
subject-matter experts.  In practice, the method provides superior
predictive power relative to any single component and reduces the
likelihood of dramatic miss-predictions as it is not reliant on any
one data source or methodology.

{\bf Intellectual merit:} This project will address several
substantive questions in political science, with a focus on the fields
of international relations, where policymakers have a particular
demand for improved forecasting, and elections.  Prediction of socially
determined outcomes has recently gained favor in political science,
but to date all efforts have been directed at finding the ``best''
models, rather than making the best predictions.  In addition, the
proposed project will include research on the comparative value of the
various forecast comparison metrics for applied analysis in the social
science.  It will also provide basic research into prior structures
that penalize model complexity and ensure that ensemble forecasts
reflect uncertainty in component forecasts, data vintage, and
missingness.  EBMA has received attention in the fields of
statistics, meteorology, and (to a lesser extent) economics.  Yet, it
has not been advanced in the methodological directions herein
proposed.

{\bf Broader impacts:} Testing systematic predictions about future
events against observed outcomes is generally seen as the most
stringent validity check of statistical \emph{and} theoretical models.
Yet, political scientists rarely make predictions about the future;
instead, they typically focus on developing and validating theories
that explain past events. However, research in political science could
gain immensely in its policy relevance if predictions were more common
and more accurate.  Improved forecasting of important political events
would make research more germane to policymakers and the general
public who may be less interested in explaining the past than
anticipating and altering the future.  From a scientific standpoint,
greater attention to forecasting would facilitate stringent validation
of statistical models since truly causal models should perform better
in out-of-sample forecasting. More widespread usage of prediction
heuristics should also help anneal theoretical models.

This project will further develop statistical techniques that improve
the capabilities of researchers across disciplines to produce more
accurate forecasts of future events. The methodological advancement
made in this project will be available to the social science community
and influence research agendas in multiple fields.  This is
particularly important as existing research projects and software
packages for ensemble forecasting are narrowly tailored to the needs
of weather forecasting.

Finally, the principal investigators are active members of the
research community at the intersection of statistics and the social
sciences. Their work is widely read in political science and other
disciplines. Further, at least two graduate students in political
science and/or statistical science will be included in the research and
will gain experience in large-scale research projects.

\section*{Project Description}

Testing systematic predictions about future events against observed
outcomes is generally seen as the most stringent validity check of
statistical and theoretical models.  Yet, political scientists rarely
make predictions about the future.  Empirical models are seldom
applied to out-of-sample data and are even more rarely used to make
predictions about future outcomes. Instead, researchers typically
focus on developing and validating theories that explain past events.

In part, this results from the fact that it is difficult to make
accurate predictions about complex social phenomena. However, research
in political science could gain immensely in its policy relevance if
predictions were more common and more accurate.  Improved forecasting
of important political events would make research more germane to
policymakers and the general public who may be less interested in
explaining the past than anticipating and altering the future.  From a
scientific standpoint, greater attention to forecasting would
facilitate stringent validation of theoretical and statistical models
since truly causal models should perform better in out-of-sample
forecasting.

We propose to extend a promising statistical method -- ensemble
Bayesian model averaging (EBMA) -- and to develop software that will
aid scholars across disciplines to make more accurate forecasts employing
realistic assessments of the uncertainty, calibration, and sharpness of their
predictions.
This project builds on work in the fields of meteorology and
statistics to (1) extend the method for application to a wider array
of outcomes (e.g., binary data), (2) provide freely available software
that implements both maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation
techniques, and (3) publish papers that provide accessible
explanations of the method and social science applications.

% First, we briefly review existing political science research aimed at
% forecasting.  We then present the EBMA method.  Next we present
% results from empirical applications of the method to the areas of
% insurgency events on the Pacific Rim, U.S. presidential elections, and
% voting on the U.S. Supreme Court.  We discuss our proposed research
% agenda and conclude with a discussion of results from prior NSF
% supported research.

\section{Dynamic forecasting in political science}

Although forecasting remains a rare exercise in political science, there
is an increasing number of exceptions.  In most cases, ``forecasts''
are conceptualized as an exercise in which the predicted values of a
dependent variable are calculated based on a specific statistical
model and then compared with observed values
\citep[e.g.,][]{Hildebrand:etal:1976}. In many instances, this reduces
to an analysis of residuals.  In others, the focus is on randomly
selecting subsets of the data to be excluded during model development
for cross-validation.  However, there is also a more limited tradition
of making forecasts about events that have not yet occurred.

An early proponent of using statistical models to make predictions in
the realm of international relations (IR) was Stephen Andriole
\citep{Andriole:Young:1977}. In 1978, a volume edited by Nazli Choucri
and Thomas Robinson \nocite{Choucri:Robinson:1978} provided an
overview of the then current work in forecasting in IR.  Much of this
work was done in the context of policy-oriented research for the
U.S. government during the Vietnam War.  Subsequently, there were 
several efforts to create or evaluate forecasts of international
conflict including \citet{Freeman:Job:1979},
\citet{Singer:Wallace:1979}, and \citet{Vincent:1980}. In
addition, a few efforts began to generate forecasts of domestic
conflict \citep[e.g.,][]{Gurr:Lichbach:1986}.  Recent years,
however, have witnessed increasing interest in prediction across a
wide array of contexts in IR.\footnote{An incomplete list of recent
  work would include \citet{Krause:1997}, \citet{Davies:Gurr:1998},
  \citet{Pevehouse:Goldstein:1999}, \citet{Schrodt:Gerner:2000},
  \citet{King:Zeng:2001}, \citet{OBrien:2002}, \citet{BDM:2002},
  \citet{Fearon:Laitin:2003}, \citet{Demarchi:etal:2004}, \citet{Enders:Sandler:2005},
  \citet{Leblang:Satyanath:2006}, \citet{Ward:etal:2007},
  \citet{Brandt:etal:2008}, \citet{Bennett:Stam:2009}, and
  \citet{Gleditsch:Ward:2010}. A summary of classified efforts is
  reported in \citet{Feder:2002}.  An overview of some of the
  historical efforts along with a description of current thinking
  about forecasting and decision-support is given by
  \citet{OBrien:2010}.}  The 2011 special issue of \emph{Conflict
  Management and Peace Science} on prediction in the field of IR
typifies this growing emphasis on forecasting
\citep[c.f.,][]{Schneider_etal_2011, Mesquita_2011,
  Brandt_etal_2011}. 
  
Outside of IR, forecasting in political science has largely taken
place in the context of election research.  In the 1990s, scholars of
U.S. politics began publishing predictions of presidential elections
\citep{Campbell:1990, Campbell:1992}. These efforts were anticipated
by the efforts of several economists, most notably the forecast
established by Ray C. Fair (\citeyear{Fair:1978}). As we discuss
below, predicting U.S. presidential and congressional elections has
since developed into a regular exercise.  Moreover, researchers have
begun to forecast election outcomes in France
\citep[e.g.,][]{Jerome:1999} and the United Kingdom
\citep[e.g.,][]{Whitely:2005}. \citet{Lewis-Beck:2005} provides a more
in-depth discussion of election forecasting in a comparative context.
More recently, \citet{brandt:freeman:schrodt:2011} have provided a
thorough survey of how forecasts have been compared in political
science and economics, with a focus on strategies for more meticulous
comparison of the accuracy of forecasts.

While efforts to predict future outcomes remain uncommon, research
that combines multiple forecasts are nearly non-existant.  To our
knowledge, the only non-IR example is the PollyVote project
\citep[c.f.][]{Graefe:2010}, which combines multiple predictions using
simple averages to forecast U.S. presidential elections.

EBMA is a statistical approach that promises to improve prediction of
outcomes determined by complex social processes and build upon the
increased interest in generating political forecasts. In essence, EBMA
improves prediction by pooling information from multiple forecast
models to generate ensemble predictions similar to a weighted average
of component forecasts. The weight assigned to each forecast is
calibrated via its performance in some training period.  These
component models can be diverse.  They need not share covariates,
functional forms, or error structures. Indeed, the components may not
even be statistical models, but may be predictions generated by
agent-based models, stochastic simulations, or subject-matter experts.


Ensemble methods have been shown to significantly reduce prediction
error in two important ways.  First, ensemble predictions are usually
more accurate than any individual component model. Second, they are
significantly less likely to make dramatically incorrect predictions
\citep{Bates:1969, Armstrong:2001, Raftery:2005}.\footnote{The case
  for using predictions heuristically can also be found in early work
  by Dawid \citep{dawid:1982,dawid:1984}.}  Combining forecasts not
only reduces reliance on single data sources and methodologies, but
generally allows for the incorporation of more information than any
one theoretical or statistical model is likely to include in
isolation.


\setcounter{section}{1}

\section{Ensemble Bayesian model averaging} 

Predictive models remain underutilized, yet an increasing number of
scholars have developed forecasting models for specific research
domains.  As the number of forecasting efforts proliferate, however,
there is a growing benefit from developing methods to pool across
models and methodologies to generate more accurate forecasts.  Very
often, specific predictive models prove to be correct only for certain
subsets of observations.  Moreover, stand-alone models tend to be more
sensitive to unusual events or particular data issues than ensemble
methods.

The research proposed here will aid the newfound emphasis on
prediction by advancing recent statistical research aimed at
integrating multiple predictions into a single improved forecast.  In
particular, we are adapting an ensemble method first developed for
application to the most mature prediction models in existence --
weather forecasting models.  To generate predictive distributions of
outcomes (e.g., temperature), weather researchers apply ensemble
methods to forecasts generated from multiple models
\citep{Raftery:2005}.  Thus, state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts
aggregate multiple runs of (often multiple) weather prediction models
into a single unified forecast.

The particular ensemble method we are extending for application to
political outcomes is ensemble Bayesian model averaging (EBMA). First
proposed by \citet{Raftery:2005}, EBMA pools across various forecasts
while meaningfully incorporating \textit{a priori} uncertainty about
the ``best'' model.  It assumes that no particular model or
forecasting method can fully encapsulate the true data-generating
process.  Rather, various research teams or statistical techniques
will reflect different facets of reality. EBMA collects \textit{all}
of the insights from multiple forecasting efforts in a coherent
manner.  The aim is not to choose a model, but rather to incorporate
the insights and knowledge implicit in various forecasting efforts via
statistical post-processing.

EBMA itself is an extension of the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA)
methodology \citep[c.f.,][]{Madigan:1994, Draper:1995, Raftery:1995,
  Hoeting:1999, Clyde:2003, Raftery:2003, Clyde:2004}.  BMA was first
introduced to political science by \citet{Bartels:1997} and has been
applied in a number of contexts \citep[e.g.,][]{Bartels:2001,
  Gill:2004, Imai:2004, Geer:2006b}. \citet{Montgomery:2010c} provide
a more in-depth discussion of BMA and its applications in political
science.

\subsection{Mathematical foundation}
Assume we have some quantity of interest in the future to forecast,
$\mathbf{y}^*$, based on training data $\mathbf{y}^T$ that is fit to
$K$ statistical models, $M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_K$. Each model, $M_k$, is
assumed to come from the prior probability distribution $M_k\sim
\pi(M_k)$, and the probability distribution function (PDF) for the
training data is $p(\mathbf{y}^T|M_k)$. The outcome of interest is
distributed $p(\mathbf{y}^*|M_k$).  Applying Bayes Rule
\begin{equation} \small
p(M_k|\mathbf{y}^T) = \frac{p(\mathbf{y}^T|M_k)\pi(M_k)}{\underset{k=1}{\overset{K}{\sum}}p(\mathbf{y}^T|M_k)\pi(M_k)},
\end{equation}
\noindent and the marginal predictive PDF for $y^*$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{BMA-pdf}
\small
p(\mathbf{y}^*) = \underset{k=1}{\overset{K}{\sum}} p(\mathbf{y}^*|M_k)p(M_k|\mathbf{y}^T).
\end{equation}
The BMA PDF (\ref{BMA-pdf}) can be viewed as the weighted average of
the component PDFs where the weights are determined by each model's
performance within the training data.  Likewise, we can simply make a
deterministic estimate using the weighted predictions of the
components, denoted
\begin{equation} \small
E(\mathbf{y}^*) = \underset{k=1}{\overset{K}{\sum}} E(\mathbf{y}^*|M_k)p(M_k|\mathbf{y}^T).
\end{equation}

\subsection{EBMA for dynamic settings}

We now turn to applying this basic BMA technology to prediction in a
dynamic setting.  In generating predictions of important events (e.g.,
domestic crises or international disputes), the task is to first build
a statistical model for some set of observations $S$ in time periods
$T$, which we refer to as the training
period.\footnote{\citet{Sloughter:2007} make predictions for only one
  future time period, and use only a subset of past time-periods (they
  recommend 30) in their training data. Thus, predictions are made
  sequentially with the entire EBMA procedure being re-calculated for
  each future event as observations are moved from the out-of-sample
  period $T^*$ into the training set $T$. Another alternative is to
  simply divide \textit{all} the data into discrete training and test
  periods for the entire procedure.  We use both approaches in our
  examples below.}  Using the same statistical model (or general
technique in the case of subject-expert predictions), we then generate
forecasts, $\mathbf{f}_k$, for observations $S$ in future time periods
$T^*$.

Let us assume, for example, that we have $K$ models forecasting
insurgencies in a set of countries $S$. Each component forecast,
$\mathbf{f}_k$, is associated with a component PDF,
$g_k(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{f}_k)$, which may be the original predictive
PDF from the forecast model or a bias-corrected forecast.  These
components are the conditional PDFs of outcome $\mathbf{y}$ given the
$k$th forecast, $\mathbf{f}_k$ assuming that $P(M_k | \mathbf{y})
\equiv w_k=1$, or that the posterior odds of model $k$ is unity.

% This
% assumes that $P(M_k | \mathbf{y}) \equiv w_k=1$, or the posterior odds
% of model $k$ is unity.

%  being the ``best''
% forecast in the ensemble. For example, the posterior PDF of an outcome
% $y_{st}$ for some country $s \in S$ in period $t \in T$ given the
% forecast $f_{kst}$ from model $k$ is $g_k(y_{st}|f_{kst})$. 

The EBMA PDF is then a finite mixture of the $K$ component forecasts,
denoted
\begin{equation}
\small
\label{BMA-eq}
p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{f}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{f}_K)=\overset{K}{\underset{k=1}{\sum}} w_k
g_k(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{f}_k),
\end{equation}
\noindent where the weight, $w_k$, is based on forecast $k$'s relative
predictive performance in the training period $T$. The $w_k$'s $\in
[0,1]$ are probabilities and $\sum_{k=1}^Kw_k=1$.  The specific PDF of
for an out-of-sample event, $y_{st^*}$, is therefore
\begin{equation}
\label{BMA-eq2}
\small
p(y_{st^*}|f_{1st^*}, \ldots,
f_{Kst^*})=\overset{K}{\underset{k=1}{\sum}} w_k
g_k(y_{st^*}|f_{kst^*}).
\end{equation}
\subsection{EBMA for normally-distributed outcomes}

When forecasting outcomes that are distributed according to the normal
distribution, \citet{Raftery:2005} propose approximating the
conditional PDF as a normal distribution centered at a linear
transformation of the individual forecast, $g_k(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{f}_k) = N(a_{k0} + a_{k1}\mathbf{f}_k,
\sigma^2)$.  Using \eqref{BMA-eq} above, the EBMA PDF is then
\begin{equation} \small
p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{f}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{f}_K) = \overset{K}{\underset{k=1}{\sum}} w_k N(a_{k0} +
a_{k1}\mathbf{f}_k, \sigma^2).
\end{equation}

\subsection{The dichotomous outcome model}

Past work on EBMA does not apply directly to the prediction of many
political events because the assumed PDFs are normal, Poisson, or
gamma. In many settings (e.g., international conflicts), the data are
not sufficiently fine-grained to justify these distributional
assumptions.  Usually, the outcomes of interest are dichotomous
indicators for whether an event (e.g., civil war) has occurred in a
given time period and country. Thus, none of the distributional
assumptions used in past work are appropriate in this context.
Fortunately, it is a straightforward extension of
\citet{Sloughter:2007} and \citet{Sloughter:2010} to deal
appropriately with binary outcomes.

% \footnote{The method for dealing with
%   binary outcomes is implicit in \citet{Sloughter:2007} and
%   \citet{Sloughter:2010}, which assume a discrete-continuous 
%   distribution for outcomes that include a logistic component.
%   However, they do not explicitly and fully develop the model for
%   dichotomous outcomes.  A related strain of research on Dynamic Model
%   Averaging \citep[c.f.,][]{Raftery:2010, Muhlbaier:2007} has recently
%   been extended for direct application to binary outcomes
%   \citep[e.g.,][]{Mccormick:2011, Tomas:2011}.}

We follow \citet{Sloughter:2007} and \citet{Hamill:2004} in using
logistic regression after a power transformation of the forecast to
reduce prediction bias. For notational ease, we assume that $\mathbf{f}_k$ is the
forecast after the adjustment for bias reduction.  Therefore, let
$\mathbf{f}'_k \in [0,1]$ be the forecast on the predicted probability scale
 and
\begin{equation}
\small
%\begin{array}{rl}
\mathbf{f}_k =  \left[(1+\mbox{logit}(\mathbf{f}'_k))^{1/b} - 1\right]I\left[\mathbf{f}'_k>\frac{1}{2}\right]  - \left[(1+\mbox{logit}(|\mathbf{f}'_k|))^{1/b} -  1\right]I\left[\mathbf{f}'_k<\frac{1}{2}\right],
%\end{array}
 \end{equation}
 \noindent where $I[.]$ is the general indicator function.
 \citet{Hamill:2004} recommend setting $b=4$, while
 \citet{Sloughter:2007} use $b=3$.  We found that $b=4$ works best in
 the examples below, but other analysts may try alternative
 specifications. This transformation dampens the effect of extreme observations and reduces over-fitting.

The logistic model for the outcome variables is % \footnote{Likewise, $\mbox{logit } P(\mathbf{y}=0|\mathbf{f}_k) \equiv
 % \mbox{log}\frac{P(\mathbf{y}=0|\mathbf{f}_k)}{P(\mathbf{y}=1|\mathbf{f}_k)}$.}
\begin{equation} \small
\label{one}
\mbox{logit } P(\mathbf{y}=1|\mathbf{f}_k) \equiv \mbox{log}\frac{P(\mathbf{y}=1|\mathbf{f}_k)}{P(\mathbf{y}=0|\mathbf{f}_k)} = a_{k0}+a_{k1}\mathbf{f}_k .
\end{equation}
\noindent The conditional PDF of some within-sample event, given the
forecast $f_{kst}$ and the assumption that $k$ is the true model, can
be written
\begin{equation} 
\label{component-eq}
\small
g_k(y_{st}|f_{kst}) = P(y_{st}=1|f_{kst})I[y_{st}=1]  + P(y_{st}=0|f_{kst})I[y_{st}=0].
\end{equation}
Applying this to \eqref{BMA-eq}, the PDF of the final EBMA model for
$y_{st}$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{pdf}
\small
\begin{array}{rl}
p(y_{st}|f_{1st}, f_{2st}, \ldots, f_{Kst}) = &
\overset{K}{\underset{k=1}{\sum}} w_k [
P(y_{st}=1|f_{kst})I[y_{st}=1] \\
& + P(y_{st}=0|f_{kst})I[y_{st}=0]].\end{array}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Parameter estimation by maximum likelihood and EM
algorithm}

Parameter estimation is conducted using only the data from the
training period $T$.  The parameters $a_{0k}$ and $a_{1k}$ are
specific to each individual component model.  For model $k$, these
parameters can be estimated as traditional linear models where
$\mathbf{y}$ is the dependent variable with a constant and the
covariate $\mathbf{f}_k$.

The difficulty is in estimating the weighting parameters,
$w_k~\forall~ k \in [1, 2, \dots, K]$. One approach we
propose to implement with NSF support is to place priors on all
parameters and conduct a fully Bayesian analysis with Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques \citep[c.f.][]{Vrugt:2008}.  For the moment,
however, we have followed \citet{Raftery:2005} and
\citet{Sloughter:2007} in using maximum likelihood methods.

With standard independence assumptions, the log-likelihood for the
model weights is
\begin{equation}
\small
  \ell (w_1, \ldots, w_K | a_{01},  \ldots, a_{0K}; a_{11},
  \ldots, a_{1K})= \underset{s,t}{\sum}\mbox{log }p(y_{st} |
  f_{1st}, \ldots, f_{Kst}).
\end{equation}
\noindent where the summation is over values of $s$ and $t$ that index
all observations in the training time period, and $p(y_{st}|f_{1st},
\ldots, f_{Kst}) $ is given by \eqref{pdf}. The log-likelihood
function cannot be maximized analytically, but \citet{Raftery:2005}
and \citet{Sloughter:2007} suggest using the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm.  We introduce the unobserved quantities $z_{kst}$,
which represent the posterior probability for model $k$ for
observation $y_{st}$.  The E step involves calculating estimates for
these unobserved quantities using the formula
\begin{equation}
\small
\hat{z}^{(j+1)}_{kst} = \frac{\hat{w}^{(j)}_k
p^{(j)}(y_{st}|f_{kst})}{\overset{K}{\underset{k=1}{\sum}}\hat{w}^{(j)}_kp^{(j)}(y_{st}|f_{kst})},
\end{equation}
\noindent where the superscript $j$ refers to the $j$th iteration of
the EM algorithm.


It follows that $w_k^{(j)}$ is the estimate of $w_k$ in the $j$th
iteration and $p^{(j)}(.)$ is shown in \eqref{pdf}.  Assuming these
estimates of $z_{kst}$ are correct, it is then straightforward to
derive the maximizing value for the model weights. Thus, the M step
estimates these as
$\hat{w}^{(j+1)}_k=\frac{1}{n}\underset{s,t}{\sum}\hat{z}^{(j+1)}_{kst}$,
where $n$ represents the number of observations in the training
dataset.  The E and M steps are iterated until the improvement in the
log-likelihood is no larger than some pre-defined
tolerance.\footnote{Although the log-likelihood will increase after
  each iteration of the algorithm, convergence is only guaranteed to a
  local maximum of the likelihood function.  Convergence to the global
  maximum is not assured, and the model may be sensitive to initial
  conditions. As part of our proposed research, we will explore these
  convergence issues more fully with special attention paid to
  comparison with fully Bayesian implementations. In the examples
  below, we begin with the assumption that all models are equally
  likely, $w_k = \frac{1}{K} ~ \forall ~ k \in [1, \ldots, K]$.}


% \footnote{In the case of normally distributed data,
%   $\hat{\sigma}^{2(j+1)}=\frac{1}{n}\underset{s,t}{\sum}\overset{K}{\underset{k=1}{\sum}}\hat{z}^{(j+1)}_{kst}(y_{st}-f_{kst})^2$.}



\subsection{Ensemble prediction}

With these parameter estimates, it is now possible to generate
ensemble forecasts. If our forecasts, $\mathbf{f}_k$, are generated
from a statistical model, we now generate a new prediction,
$f_{kst^\ast}$, from the previously fitted models. For convenience,
let $\hat{\mathbf{a}}_k \equiv (\hat{a}_{k0}, \hat{a}_{k1})$. For some
dichotomous observation in country $s\in S$ in the out-of-sample
period $t^\ast\in T^\ast$, we can see that
\begin{equation}
\label{nothing}
{\small
P(y_{st^*} = 1 | f_{1st^\ast}, \ldots, f_{Kst^\ast} ;  \hat{\mathbf{a}}_1,
 \ldots, \hat{\mathbf{a}}_K ; \hat{w}_1, \ldots, \hat{w}_K) =
 \overset{K}{\underset{k=1}{\sum}} \hat{w}_k
 \mbox{logit}^{-1}\left(\hat{a}_{k0} +  \hat{a}_{k1}f_{kst^\ast}\right).}
\end{equation}



\section{Empirical applications}

\subsection{Application to insurgency forecasting}

Our first example applies the EBMA method to data collected for the
Integrated Crisis Early Warning Systems (ICEWS) project sponsored by
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).  The task of
the ICEWS project is train models on data (focusing on five outcomes
of interest) for 29 countries for every month from 1997 through the
present and to then make predictions about expected crisis events over

The bulk of the data for the ICEWS project is gleaned from natural
language processing of a continuously updated harvest of news. These
are digested with a version of the TABARI processor for events
developed by Philip Schrodt and colleagues in the context of the Event
Data Project (see \url{http://eventdata.psu.edu/} for more details).
These data are augmented with a variety of covariates including:
country-level attributes from the Polity and World Bank datasets,
information about election cycles (if any), events in neighboring
countries, and the length of shared borders.

\subsubsection{Component Models}

We estimate three exemplar statistical models using data for the
in-sample period ranging from January 1999 to December 2008 and fit an
EBMA model.  We then make out-of-sample forecasts for the period from
January 2009 to December 2010 for the component and EBMA models.  To
provide variation in the complexity (as well as accuracy) of the
components, we included the following models.

\begin{list}{\labelitemi}{\leftmargin=1em}
\item \textbf{SAE}: This is one model developed as part of the ICEWS
  project and was designed by Strategic Analysis Enterprises. It is
  specified as a simple logistic model including 27 different
  independent variables.\footnote{See
    \url{strategicanalysisenterprises.com} for more details.}  All of the variables are taken from the ICEWS
  event-stream data.
\item \textbf{GLM}: For the purposes of demonstrating the performance
  of EBMA, we estimated a crude logistic model that
  includes only \textit{population size} and \textit{GDP growth} (both
  lagged three months).
\item \textbf{LMER}: This is a generalized linear mixed effects model
  using a logistic link function and includes random country-level
  intercepts as well as random country-level coefficients for
  \textit{per capita GDP}.  The list of covariates includes:
  \textit{population size}, the \textit{executive constraint} and
  \textit{competitiveness of participation} variables from the Polity
  IV dataset \citep{PolityIV}, \textit{proximity to
    election},\footnote{This is calculated as the number of days to
    the next or from the last election, whichever is closer.} and a
  \textit{spatial lag} that reflects recent occurrences of
  insurgencies in the countries' geographic
  neighbors.\footnote{Geographical proximity is measured in terms of
    the length of the shared border between the two countries.}
\end{list}

Table \ref{InSam1} shows the EBMA model parameters as well as fit
statistics associated with the individual component models and the
EBMA predictions for the in-sample time period. The first column shows
the weights that the EBMA model assigned to each component. As can be
seen, the GLM model is effectively excluded, while the SAE model
carries the greatest weight followed by the LMER model.  The constant
term refers to the term $a_{k0}$ in (\ref{one}), while the predictor
corresponds to $a_{k1}$.  The other columns in Table \ref{InSam1} are
fit statistics.  AUC is the area under the receiver-operating
characteristic (ROC) curve. The advantage of using ROC curves is that
it evaluates forecasts in a way that is less dependent on cutoff
points.  A value of 1 means that all observations are predicted
correctly at all possible cutoff points \citep{King:Zeng:2001}.







We compare the models using three additional
metrics.\footnote{\citet{brandt:freeman:schrodt:2011} survey a variety
  of metrics in addition to those we employ here. These include
  measures of average prediction errors, measures using medians and
  geometric averages, measures which compare the complete difference
  in probability distributions, and sequential rank-based methods.  As
  we discuss below, we intend to explore the relative merits of the
  various model comparison techniques as part of this project.  In any
  case, at least for the alternative metrics we have calculated so
  far, the substantive conclusions we reach do not change for our
  examples and they are not presented due to space constraints} The
proportional reduction in error (PRE) is the percentage increase of
correctly predicted observations relative to some pre-defined base
model. In this case, the base model is predicting ``no insurgencies''
for all observations.  Insurgencies are relatively rare events.  Thus,
predicting a zero for all observations leads to an 89\% correct
prediction rate. The Brier score is the average squared deviation of
the predicted probability from the true event (0 or 1).  Thus, a lower
score corresponds to higher forecast accuracy \citep{Brier:1950}.
Finally, we calculate the percentage of observations that each model
would predict correctly using a 0.5 threshold on the predicted
probability scale. 




There are two aspects of Table \ref{InSam1} that are important to
note.  First, the EBMA model does at least as well (and usually
better) than all of the component models on each our model fit
statistics.  The EBMA model has the highest AUC, PRE, and \% correct.
In addition, it is tied for the lowest Brier score with the SAE model.
Second, in this example the EBMA procedure assigns probability weights
to each model according to their in-sample performance.  The largest
weight (0.57) is assigned to the SAE model, which appears to be
the strongest component as measured by all the
fit statistics. Meanwhile, the smallest weight (0.00) is assigned to
the rudimentary GLM model.






Figure \ref{InSam1sep} shows separation plots for the EBMA model and
the individual components \citep{Greenhill:2011}. In each plot, the
observations are ordered from left to right by increasing predicted
probabilities of insurgency (as predicted by the particular
model). The black line corresponds to the predicted probability
produced by the relevant model for each observation and actual
occurrences of insurgencies are colored red.  Figure \ref{InSam1sep}
shows visually that the GLM model performs very poorly, whereas of the
SAE model is the best component.  More importantly, the overall best
performance is associated with the EBMA forecast. The separation plots
show that it produces few false positives and even fewer
false negatives than any of the component models.

The more interesting evaluation of the EBMA method is its
out-of-sample predictive power. Table \ref{OutSam1} shows fit
statistics for the individual components as well as the EBMA forecasts
for observations in the 24 months following the training period.
While the EBMA model has a marginally smaller area under the ROC curve
than the LMER models, it outperforms all component models on the other
metrics. In particular, the EBMA model has the highest PRE at 0.18.
Since it is possible to predict 89.22\% of these observations
correctly by forecasting no insurgency, an 18\% reduction of error
relative to the baseline model is quite substantial.

Figure \ref{OutSam1sep} shows the separation plots for the components
as well as the EBMA forecasts for the out-of-sample data.  The EBMA
model performs better than any of the individual components, assigning
high predicted probabilities for most observed insurgencies.  Taking
both the fit statistics and the visual evidence together, we can
conclude that the EBMA model leads to a substantial improvement in
out-of-sample forecasts relative to its components.




\subsection{Application to US presidential election forecasts}
For the past several U.S. election cycles, a number of research teams
have developed forecasting models and published their predictions in
advance of Election Day.  For example, before the 2008 election, a
symposium was published in \emph{PS: Political Science and Politics}
with forecasts of presidential and congressional vote shares developed
by \citet{Campbell:2008}, \citet{Norpoth:2008},
\citet{Lewis-Beck:Tien:2008}, \citet{Abramowitz:2008},
\citet{Erikson:Wlezien:2008}, \citet{Holbrook:2008},
\citet{Lockerbie:2008} and \citet{Cuzan:Bundrick:2008}. Earlier, in
1999, an entire issue of the \textit{International Journal of
  Forecasting} was dedicated to the prediction of presidential
elections \citep{Brown:1999}.  This topic has also drawn the attention
of economists seeking to understand the relationship between economic
fundamentals and political outcomes.  Two prominent examples include
work by Fair (\citeyear{Fair:2010}) and Hibbs (\citeyear{Hibbs:2000}).

\subsubsection{Component Models}

In the rest of this subsection, we replicate several of these models
and demonstrate the usefulness of the EBMA methodology for improving
the prediction of single important events.  We include six of the most
widely cited presidential forecasting models: Campbell's
(\citeyear{Campbell:2008}) ``Trial-Heat and Economy Model'',
Lewis-Beck and Tien's (\citeyear{Lewis-Beck:Tien:2008}) ``Jobs Model
Forecast'', Erikson and Wlezien's (\citeyear{Erikson:Wlezien:2008})
``Leading Economic Indicators and Poll'' forecast, Fair's
(\citeyear{Fair:2010}) presidential vote-share model, Hibbs'
(\citeyear{Hibbs:2000}) ``Bread and Peace Model'', and the
``Time-for-Change Model'' created by
\citet{Abramowitz:2008}.  \noindent With the exception of the Hibbs
forecast, the models are simple linear regressions. The dependent
variable is the share of the two-party vote received by the
incumbent-party candidate.\footnote{We replicated Column 2 in Table 2
  in \citet{Erikson:Wlezien:2008} and Equation 1 in
  \citet{Fair:2010}. The data to replicate the models by
  \citet{Abramowitz:2008}, \citet{Campbell:2008},
  \citet{Erikson:Wlezien:2008}, and \citet{Lewis-Beck:Tien:2008} were
  provided in personal correspondence with the respective authors.
  The remaining data were downloaded from the web sites of Ray C. Fair
  \nocite{Fair2011} and Douglas Hibbs\nocite{Hibbs2011}.}



\subsubsection{Results}

Rather than selecting a single training period (as in the insurgency
analysis) we generate sequential predictions.  For each year from 1976
to 2008, we use all available prior data to fit the component
models.\footnote{For example, the Fair model uses data for election
  results beginning in 1916 while the Abramowitz model begins with
  data from the 1952 election. }  We then fit the EBMA model using the
components' in-sample performances for election years beginning with
1952 (the year when all models begin generating predictions).  For
example, to generate predictions for the 1988 election, we used the
in-sample performance of each component for the 1952-1984 period to
estimate model weights.\footnote{Results in this section were computed
  using modifications of the `ensembleBMA' package
  \citep{Fraley:2010b, Fraley:Forthcoming}.  Because of the paucity of
  data, we did not apply any bias correction to these forecasts.  Thus,
  the predictor and constant, denoted $a_{0k}$ and $a_{1k}$ above, are
  constrained to zero and one respectively.}

Results for the individual elections (not shown here) illustrate three
points.  First, the EBMA model again does better than any individual
component on in-sample measures of model fit (i.e., RMSE and MAE).
Second, EBMA is not guaranteed to generate the most accurate
prediction for any single observation, and in each year some component
models come closer to predicting the actual outcome.  However, the
EBMA model does not provide egregiously wrong predictions since it
borrows predictions from multiple components.  Moreover, as we show
below, in the aggregate the EBMA model tends to provide the best
forecast.  Third, there is not always a crisp relationship between
in-sample model performance and model weights.  For instance, the
weight for the Abramowitz model in 2008 is a modest 0.06 even though
it has the lowest RMSE and MAE of any component.  The diminished
relationship between in-sample performance and weight is a result of
high in-sample correlations between forecasts.  % For
% instance, fitted values for the Abramowitz model are correlated at
% 0.94 with the Campbell model and at 0.96 with the Lewis-Beck/Tien
% model. Thus, conditioned on knowing these forecasts, the Abramowitz
% component provides limited, additional information.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\vspace{-10pt}
\end{table}

We now turn to the relative out-of-sample performance of the EBMA and
component forecasts across the entire 1976-2008 period.  Table
\ref{Pres-Res} presents the out-of-sample statistics as well as the
percentage of observations that fall within the 67\% and 95\%
predictive intervals for each.  The main result is that EBMA model
again outperforms all components.




 In addition, the coverage statistics demonstrate better calibration
 of EBMA forecasts relative to its component models.  For instance,
 the observed outcome falls within the 67\% predictive interval for
 the Abramowitz model only three out of nine times, while it covers the
 observed values eight out of nine times for the Lewis-Beck/Tien
 model.  Meanwhile, the EBMA 90\% an 67\% predictive intervals are
 nearly perfectly calibrated.

 In a well-calibrated forecasting model, out-of-sample outcomes should
 fall within predictive intervals at a rate corresponding to their
 size.  For instance, the goal is for two-thirds of all out-of-sample
 observations to fall within their respective 67\% predictive
 intervals.  Poorly calibrated models will tend to be produce
 predictive intervals that are either too narrow, generating
 inaccurate predictions, or too large, generating predictions that are
 accurate but too vague to be useful. For example, two of the most
 accurate forecasts, the Lewis-Beck/Tien and Erikson/Wlezien models,
 make very imprecise predictions.  Thus, although they have very good
 coverage, it is at least partly because their estimates are so
 inexact.  The Campbell, Abramowitz, Fair, and Hibbs models provide
 more reasonable predictive intervals, but are less accurate than
 EBMA.


 Finally, it is worth noting an example -- very noticeable in this
 data -- of the kinds of problems that may arise when relying on a
 single model for making predictions.  From 1952 to 2004, the Campbell
 model was consistently one of the strongest performers.  Indeed, it
 made the most accurate forecast of the 2004 election.  However, one
 of the crucial variables in this model comes from polling data
 measured in early September.  As a result of the particularly late
 timing of the Republican Convention in 2008, it was the only model to
 forecast a victory for John McCain.  By relying on a wider array of
 data sources and methodologies, EBMA reduces the likelihood of such
 large misses without completely eliminating the general insights
 captured by individual models that may on occasion be wide of the
 mark.

\subsection{Application to Supreme Court Forecasting Project}

Our final application of EBMA is a re-analysis of data from the
Supreme Court Forecasting Project \citep{Ruger:2004,
  Martin:2004}.\footnote{Additional details about the project,
  replication files, as well as a complete listing of cases and expert
  forecasts are available at: \url{http://wusct.wustl.edu/index.php}.}
This example highlights the ability of EBMA to handle forecasts
generated by classification trees, subject experts, and other sources.

Throughout 2002-2003, a research team consisting of Andrew Martin,
Kevin Quinn, Theodore Ruger, and Pauline Kim (henceforward MQRK)
generated two sets of forecasts for every pending case.  First, using
data about case characteristics and justices' voting patterns, MQRK
developed classification trees to generate a binary forecasts for the
vote of each justice on each case (voting to affirm the lower court is
coded as a 1).  Second, MQRK recruited a team of 83 prominent legal
experts to make forecasts on particular cases in their specialty area.
MQRK attempted to recruit three expert forecasts for each case,
although this was not possible for all cases.

The statistical model makes predictions for all 67 cases included in
the MQRK analysis.  Thus, we include the binary model predictions as
one component forecast. However, the individual legal experts made
predictions on only a handful of cases. Owing to the paucity of the
data for each judge, we pooled them together and treat all of the
expert opinions as part of a single forecasting effort.  Specifically,
we coded the expert forecast to be the mean expert prediction. We fit
an EBMA model using all cases with docket numbers dating from 2001
(n=395) and made EBMA forecasts for the remaining 296 cases with 2002
docket numbers.

 \subsubsection{Results}

 Table \ref{SC-Res} shows the component weights for the two forecasts
 and the out-of-sample fit statistics for the MQRK classification
 trees, the subject experts, and the EBMA forecast. Once again, the
 results show that the EBMA procedure outperforms all components (even
 when there are only two).  In terms of PRE,\footnote{The baseline model
   here is prediction that all votes will be to reverse the lower
   court.  This baseline model is correct for roughly 70\% of the
   votes in the out-of-sample period.} AUC, Brier scores, and correct
 predictions, the EBMA forecast outperforms both the statistical model
 and the combined subject experts.

There is a long-standing debate in many circles of the relative
strengths and weaknesses of statistical models and subject experts in
forecasting \citep[e.g.,][]{Ascher:1979}.  Models that use
quantifiable measurements and widely available data to make
predictions can make egregious errors in particular cases that are
decided by forces invisible to the statistical model but obvious to
experts familiar with the case.  Subject experts, on the other hand,
can become too focused on minutia and miss larger (if more subtle)
trends in the data easily recognized by more advanced methodologies.
However, the EBMA technique offers a theoretically motivated way to
combine the strengths of both methods, while smoothing over their
relative weaknesses, to make more accurate predictions.

\section{Proposed research and timeline}

Thus far, we have extended prior research to make EBMA applicable to
binary and continuous outcomes in political science.  As the above
examples demonstrate, the method already increases the accuracy of
predictions.  However, we propose to expand this research in several
ways.

\textbf{Fully Bayesian estimation:} MCMC estimation of EBMA models can
more efficiently handle a wider variety of outcome distributions
\citep{Vrugt:2008}.  Standard Bayesian methods, such as data
augmentation, will allow us to build a set of statistical results and
computer algorithms appropriate for an array of assumed outcome
distributions.  Specifically, we plan to conduct basic research to
develop a class of models and MCMC samplers to handle continuous,
censored-continuous, binary, and event count data. Moreover, as the
number of parameters is relatively moderate, Bayesian algorithms also
promise to provide fast results while eliminating concerns about false
convergence to local maxima that can occur when using EM methods.
  
This is not just an opportunity to improve computing efficiency.  It
is also an opportunity to calculate predictive density functions
(rather than point estimates) for both component and ensemble
forecasts. This permits a broader range of heuristic evaluations
including point, interval, and density comparisons.  It will also
facilitate our development and implementation of techniques to combine
and average models in a manner that reflects the full degree of
uncertainty associated with component forecasts.
  
\textbf{Forecast comparison metrics}: Some considerable thought has
gone into how best to combine and compare predictive ensembles, yet
there is no widely agreed upon set of metrics. See
\citet{brandt:freeman:schrodt:2011} for a survey. Indeed, it has been
shown that some of the most widely used metrics (e.g., RMSE) may give
faulty results for some kinds of models
\citep{geweke:amisano:2011}. While it is relatively easy to contribute
to the proliferation of comparison metrics (i.e., use mean, median,
mode, and geometric mean versions of standard approaches) it is rather
more difficult and more important to heuristically evaluated existing
and proposed model-comparison methods for a range of political science
models using real-world (rather than simulated) data. One planned
avenue for our research, therefore, is to: (1) implement a significant
number of existing model comparison methods within our software, and
(2) explore their value not in a rarefied simulation context, but in
the context of real political science models making predictions about
contemporary political phenomena. Our sense is that while making a
wide range of metrics computationally available is probably helpful,
in the end some smaller set of dominant metrics or comparison
heuristics will evolve and proliferate within the discipline. Thus, we
aim to provide some evidence based evidence on this point.


\textbf{Vintage data}: One important practical issue relates to the
vintage of the data used to generate forecasts.  Most of the
presidential forecasting models, for example, use data of
approximately the same vintage.  The predictors in these models are
economic indicators or polling results measured in the months just
prior to the election.  However, a few rely more heavily data measured
relatively far in advance of the election. The vintage of the data may
affect the accuracy of the forecasts during calibration, and therefore
partially determine the weights assigned each model in the ensemble.
Thus a topic for future research is on methods to incorporate the
uncertainty introduced by information vintage into the ensemble
weights.

\textbf{Missing data}: Thus far, we have assumed that all of the
models in the ensemble are working over the same time periods, both
in- and out-of-sample. Yet, for EBMA to be practicable in a many
political contexts, this constraint must be relaxed.  Doing so will
involve developing and implementing methods to handle the so-called
missing data issue. As an example, election prediction markets have
existed only since 1988 on U.S. national elections, yet the in-sample
training period begins in 1952 for our presidential vote example.
Moreover, any newly generated forecasting model may not necessarily
cascade back over all prior time periods due to data constraints or
other common issues. Finally, subject-matter experts may make useful
predictions that are useful for a selection of observations, but not
have knowledge about a complete set of events.  Nonetheless, it should
be possible to combine forecasts in a principled fashion that allows
for missingness over part (or even most) of the in-sample training
dataset.  We plan to conduct basic research, simulation work, and
applied case-studies to explore methods for generating ensembles in
these settings.

\textbf{Alternative model weights}: Currently, EBMA estimates model
weights based exclusively on the point predictions of component
forecasts.  Even for continuous data (e.g., the presidential vote
forecasts), the current procedure assumes that the within-forecast
variance ($\sigma^2$) is constant across models.  In other words,
model weights do not reflect the uncertainty associated with each
model's predictions.  Applying both Bayesian and bootstrap methods, we
intend to incorporate the entire predictive PDFs of component
forecasts so that model weights reflect not only components' accuracy,
but also their precision.  Poorly calibrated models should receive less
posterior weight.

A related issue is that, as currently constructed, EBMA makes no
adjustment for model complexity. That is, model weights are based
solely on the components’ goodness-of-fit with no effort to adjust for
their generalizability. This can lead to excessive weighting of
complex and over-fit models. Since component forecasts may be
agent-based models, stochastic simulations, multi-level models, and
the like, it is necessary to go beyond merely penalizing for the
number of parameters (e.g., AIC). Complexity measures must take into
account functional form and other concerns. We plan to incorporate
several proposed methods for penalizing complexity into the EBMA
method \citep[c.f.,][]{Pitt:2002a, Pitt:2002b, Spiegelhalter:2002}.

\textbf{Software:} We will develop open-source software that will be
publicly available.  Specifically, we will produce an R package that
implements both the binary outcome version we have already developed
and the additional extensions just discussed.  Moreover, the package
will provide a more flexible interface for users interested in
ensemble forecasting outside of the weather prediction community than
is currently available.  

Our specific goals for the software package include: S4 compliance,
computationally efficient internal functions written either in C or
Java, handling of multiple outcome distributional assumptions and
priors with a small set of user functions, Gaussian copula techniques
for handling missing data \citep{Hoff:2007}, customizable data
visualizations to facilitate EBMA and component model comparisons,
exemplar datasets and vignettes based on real-world applications of
the method to the social and physical sciences, and built-in
convergence diagnostics for all Bayesian methods compatible with the
`coda' and `boa' packages in R.  At the completion of the project, we
will submit and article to the \textit{Journal of Statistical
  Software} both explaining the technical details of the package and
providing tutorials illustrating its available features.

\textbf{Dissemination of findings}: Beyond providing the software and
its attendant documentation, we will disseminate the results of our
research in three ways.  First, we will submit articles explaining the
mathematical and technical details of EBMA to journals in political
methodology, economics, and applied statistics.  Second, we plan to
develop and publish at least two extended applications of the method
to topics in political science.  Our particular focus here will be:
(1) improved forecasting of international crisis events; (2) election
forecasting with the aim of collaborating with other scholars to
generate ensemble predictions for the 2012 U.S. elections.  Third, we
hope to offer a workshop on forecasting political outcomes during the
first day of the 2012 meeting of the Political Methods Conference
(jointly hosted by UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke University).

\textbf{Collaboration and work-plan}: As PI, Ward will take the lead
role in the project, working with Montgomery to identify achievable
production goals and deadlines, guiding basic research, and
disseminating findings through publications and presentations.
Montgomery will take a leading role in software development and
graduate student supervision. The collaborative venture
will synergistically combine the resources of two programs with strong
political methods programs that each place particular emphasis on Bayesian
approaches.  The basic timeline is:

% I am just making things up.  But sounds plausible.



\noindent \textit{01/2012 -- 06/2012}: In this stage, we will conduct
basic research into MCMC estimation of EBMA and prior structures that
penalize model complexity and ensure that posterior estimates reflect
uncertainty in component forecasts, data vintage, and missingness.

\noindent \textit{07/2012 -- 06/2013}: In this stage, we will develop,
test, and document the software. This will also involve gathering
exemplar forecasting datasets for inclusion in package vignettes.
These examples will be the basis for subsequent applied research and
publication.  In this period, we will also focus on evaluating the
numerous forecast model comparison metrics discussed above.

\noindent \textit{07/2013 -- 12/2013}: This stage will focus on: (1)
preparing software and documentation for public dissemination,
improving user interfaces, and increasing the computational efficiency
of internal functions, and (2) revision and submission of results for
publication.

\item 0417559 (\$150,000) Network Modeling of Intl. Peace and

\end{enumerate}  Only one of these grants is still open (\# 1), but these funds have
only recently (Spring 2011) been transferred to Duke University. The
most relevant grant is \# 2, which is discussed below. \vspace{.1in}

\textit{Summary of Findings:} One of our primary findings is that
standard hazard regression methods for longitudinal relational data,
using variants of proportional hazards models, are unable to properly
account for temporal or relational dependence in IR data. We have
explored several approaches to modeling the longitudinal dependencies.
One models temporal correlations directly as a network.  A second uses
the temporal evolution of the latent network as a means of imparting
dynamic structure into the estimation of the network parameters.  A
final approach, which we are completing now, involves modeling a
separate time-series regression for each pair of countries, but using
a special array-variate hierarchical model to allow for similarity in
trade patterns across groups of countries. We show that the
regularized estimates from this hierarchical model outperform existing
methods in out-of-sample prediction of longitudinal trade data.

\textit{Broader Impacts:} We have presented the research at a number
of conferences and in-departmental seminars in the fields of
statistics, biostatistics, political science, and geography. We have
created the first installment of a series of open-source software
packages for the analysis of relational data. These packages are
widely used in the social science community conducting network
analyses. Finally, we constructed a database of trade and conflict
that can be accessed by our software.

Within the first year we completed the following: (1) trained a
graduate student in the analysis of longitudinal relational data; (2)
constructed and analyzed databases on longitudinal international
relations data; (3) developed new statistical methodologies for
multivariate and longitudinal data; (4) conducted basic research in
the area of multivariate statistical models, including methods related
to copula modeling and reduced-rank matrix models; (5) conducted basic
research into the analysis of array data, such as longitudinal trade
data, using random-effects versions of multiway array methods such as
PARAFAC, and developed an extension of the multivariate and
matrix-variate normal distribution appropriate for modeling multiway
array data.

Finally, two students learned how to gather and organize data, write
technical documents, and perform independent research. Both students
completed their Ph.D. in the summer of 2010. One student (John
Ahlquist) received two national awards for his dissertation.

\subsection*{Synergistic Activities}
While on the executive council of the Center for Statistics and the
Social Sciences, I helped to develop a university wide curriculum in
applied statistical methods that would be available to social science
departments across the university. We also created new fields of
applied statistics within a total of five departments; our first was
in the department of Political Science. These served to broaden and
deepen training in statistical methods for social science graduate
students at the University of Washington.

I have also organized several conferences aimed at helping scholars in
the social sciences to apply new approaches to the study of social
phenomenon. One of these was a conference at the University of
Washington on Spatial and Network approaches to studying political
phenomenon, which was sponsored in part by the Center for Statistics
and the Social Sciences, but also funded in part by a grant from the
Center for Spatially Informed Social Sciences.

In 2010, I also organized and was the local host for the 2010 Duke
Conference on Networks in Political Science, an international and
multidisciplinary gathering of about 200 scholars and practitioners of
network science.

4. Collaborative Proposals  (pg. II-23

A collaborative proposal is one in which investigators from two or
more organizations wish to collaborate on a unified research project.
Collaborative proposals may be submitted to NSF in one of two methods:
as a single proposal, in which a single award is being requested (with
subawards administered by the lead organization); or by simultaneous
submission of proposals from different organizations, with each
organization requesting a separate award.  In either case, the lead
organization’s proposal must contain all of the requisite sections as
a single package to be provided to reviewers (that will happen
automatically when procedures below are followed).  All collaborative
proposals must clearly describe the roles to be played by the other
organizations, specify the managerial arrangements, and explain the
advantages of the multi-organizational effort within the Project
Description.  PIs are strongly encouraged to contact the cognizant NSF
Program Officer prior to submission of a collaborative proposal.


 b. Submission of a collaborative proposal from multiple organizations

In many instances, simultaneous submission of proposals that contain
the same Project Description from each organization might be
appropriate.  For these proposals, the project title must begin with
the words ``Collaborative Research:''.  The lead organization's
submission will include a Cover Sheet, Project Summary, Project
Description, References Cited, Biographical Sketches, Budgets and
Budget Justification, Current and Pending support, and Facilities,
Equipment and Other Resources for their organization.  If applicable,
the lead organization’s submission also must include a supplemental
mentoring plan that must not exceed one page, and that addresses the
mentoring activities to be provided for all postdoctoral researchers
supported under the entire collaborative project.  See GPG Chapter
II.C.2.j for additional guidance on mentoring and data management plan
requirements for collaborative proposals.  Non-lead organization
submissions will include all of the above for their organization
except the project summary, project description, and references cited
which are the same for all collaborating organizations.  FastLane will
combine the proposal submission for printing or electronic viewing.

To submit the collaborative proposal, the following process must be
completed: 

(i) Each non-lead organization must assign their proposal a proposal
PIN.  This proposal PIN and the temporary proposal ID generated by
FastLane when the non-lead proposal is created must be provided to the
lead organization before the lead organization submits its proposal to
NSF. 

(ii) The lead organization must then enter each non-lead
organization(s) proposal PIN and temporary proposal ID into the
FastLane lead proposal by using the "Link Collaborative Proposals"
option found on the FastLane "Form Preparation" screen.  Given that
such separately submitted proposals constitute a “single” proposal
submission to NSF, it is imperative that the proposals be submitted
within a reasonable timeframe to one another.  

(iii) All components of the collaborative proposal must meet any
established deadline, and, failure to do so may result in the entire
collaborative proposal being returned without review.
