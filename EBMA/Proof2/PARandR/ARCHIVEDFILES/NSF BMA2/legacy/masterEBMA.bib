	Yet, despite recent advances in political science methods, surprisingly
	little attention has been devoted to measurement validity. We address
	this gap by exploring four themes. First, we seek to establish a
	shared framework that allows quantitative and qualitative scholars
	to assess more effectively, and communicate about, issues of valid
	measurement. Second, we underscore the need to dram, a clear distinction
	between measurement issues and disputes about concepts. Third, we
	discuss the Contextual specificity of measurement claims, exploring
	a variety of measurement strategies that seek to combine generality
	and validity by devoting greater attention to context. Fourth, we
	address the proliferation of terms for alternative measurement validation
	procedures and offer an account of the three main types of validation
	most relevant to political scientists.},

	are compared and contrasted through reanalyses of data from the organizational
	research literature to establish a basis for assessing the validity
	of measures used in organizational research. Campbell and Fiske's
	(1959) criteria are found to be lacking, particularly in their assumptions,
	diagnostic information, and power. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)
	is shown to overcome most limitations inherent in Campbell and Fiske's
	procedures. Nevertheless, two potential shortcomings are identified
	with the CFA method: the confounding of random error with measure-specific
	variance and the inability to test for interactions between traits
	and methods. Three alternative methods are presented for addressing
	the former issue, and the direct product model is described as a
	solution to the latter. The techniques considered herein go farther
	than currently used procedures for enhancing our ability to ascertain
	the validity of variables commonly studied in organizational research.},

  volume = {98},
  pages = {671-686},
  number = {04},
  note = {Intuitively, people should answer the same questions the same way,
	no matter how the question is worded. We would like to think individuals
	would use the same thought process with different wording and come
	to the same conclusion. However, Druckman explains that this is not
	always the case because of the problem of issue framing. Issue framing
	is when different, but logically equivalent, words or phrases cause
	individuals to alter their preferences. For example, responses to
	the issue of hate crimes are different based on whether it is asked
	in terms of freedom of speech or public safety. Druckman makes the
	prediction that those with a greater knowledge about the topic will
	be less susceptible to issue framing. He gave almost 600 people,
	primarily students, four problems each to solve. Each problem could
	be portrayed in a positive or negative light. Two of the problems
	involved risk attitudes, in which the respondent must choose between
	two risky situations. The other two were did not involve risk attitudes.
	Each participant was randomly assigned to one of eight groups, four
	of which received positively framed questions and four which received
	negatively framed questions. The four groups of each frame were then
	separated into separate contexts: control, counter-framing, homogeneous,
	and heterogeneous. The control group simply answered the questions
	as they were. The counter-framing group received the questions for
	their frame, and then were given the questions of the opposing frame.
	In the homogeneous groups received all the same frames while in the
	heterogeneous group, two participants received each respective frame.
	In the end, the conclusion that Druckman draws is that some conditions
	led to more framing consequences than others. In certain contexts,
	people are much more likely to be subject to this framing. The control
	groups had the largest differences between the positive and negative
	frames, whereas the counter-framing groups had the least amount of
	discrepancy. Druckman recognizes that this may be a result of experimental
	design, but also believes that these results should be of concern.
	In my opinion, there are many things that can be affected by these
	results if they are taken beyond the experimental setting. For one
	thing, it helps to support the idea that anything can be proved by
	statistics, regardless of the actually validity. By changing the
	wording of issues, it can skew data so that real public opinion is
	no longer represented. At the same time, this could have implications
	for elections. In terms of candidate support, the way that candidates
	are portrayed could play a big role in their appeal. By using the
	negative frame of opponent views, it may be possible to sway voters.
	At the same time, issues on the ballot, if written differently, may
	have the ability to sway voters. Even when voters think they know
	what they want, they may be “tricked” into voting otherwise due to
	issue framing. },
  abstract = {One of the most contested questions in the social sciences is whether
	people behave rationally. A large body of work assumes that individuals
	do in fact make rational economic, political, and social decisions.
	Yet hundreds of experiments suggest that this is not the case. Framing
	effects constitute one of the most stunning and influential demonstrations
	of irrationality. The effects not only challenge the foundational
	assumptions of much of the social sciences (e.g., the existence of
	coherent preferences or stable attitudes), but also lead many scholars
	to adopt alternative approaches (e.g., prospect theory). Surprisingly,
	virtually no work has sought to specify the political conditions
	under which framing effects occur. I fill this gap by offering a
	theory and experimental test. I show how contextual forces (e.g.,
	elite competition, deliberation) and individual attributes (e.g.,
	expertise) affect the success of framing. The results provide insight
	into when rationality assumptions apply and, also, have broad implications
	for political psychology and experimental methods.},
