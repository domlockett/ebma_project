	Yet, despite recent advances in political science methods, surprisingly
	little attention has been devoted to measurement validity. We address
	this gap by exploring four themes. First, we seek to establish a
	shared framework that allows quantitative and qualitative scholars
	to assess more effectively, and communicate about, issues of valid
	measurement. Second, we underscore the need to dram, a clear distinction
	between measurement issues and disputes about concepts. Third, we
	discuss the Contextual specificity of measurement claims, exploring
	a variety of measurement strategies that seek to combine generality
	and validity by devoting greater attention to context. Fourth, we
	address the proliferation of terms for alternative measurement validation
	procedures and offer an account of the three main types of validation
	most relevant to political scientists.},

	are compared and contrasted through reanalyses of data from the organizational
	research literature to establish a basis for assessing the validity
	of measures used in organizational research. Campbell and Fiske's
	(1959) criteria are found to be lacking, particularly in their assumptions,
	diagnostic information, and power. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)
	is shown to overcome most limitations inherent in Campbell and Fiske's
	procedures. Nevertheless, two potential shortcomings are identified
	with the CFA method: the confounding of random error with measure-specific
	variance and the inability to test for interactions between traits
	and methods. Three alternative methods are presented for addressing
	the former issue, and the direct product model is described as a
	solution to the latter. The techniques considered herein go farther
	than currently used procedures for enhancing our ability to ascertain
	the validity of variables commonly studied in organizational research.},

  volume = {98},
  pages = {671-686},
  number = {04},
  note = {Intuitively, people should answer the same questions the same way,
	no matter how the question is worded. We would like to think individuals
	would use the same thought process with different wording and come
	to the same conclusion. However, Druckman explains that this is not
	always the case because of the problem of issue framing. Issue framing
	is when different, but logically equivalent, words or phrases cause
	individuals to alter their preferences. For example, responses to
	the issue of hate crimes are different based on whether it is asked
	in terms of freedom of speech or public safety. Druckman makes the
	prediction that those with a greater knowledge about the topic will
	be less susceptible to issue framing. He gave almost 600 people,
	primarily students, four problems each to solve. Each problem could
	be portrayed in a positive or negative light. Two of the problems
	involved risk attitudes, in which the respondent must choose between
	two risky situations. The other two were did not involve risk attitudes.
	Each participant was randomly assigned to one of eight groups, four
	of which received positively framed questions and four which received
	negatively framed questions. The four groups of each frame were then
	separated into separate contexts: control, counter-framing, homogeneous,
	and heterogeneous. The control group simply answered the questions
	as they were. The counter-framing group received the questions for
	their frame, and then were given the questions of the opposing frame.
	In the homogeneous groups received all the same frames while in the
	heterogeneous group, two participants received each respective frame.
	In the end, the conclusion that Druckman draws is that some conditions
	led to more framing consequences than others. In certain contexts,
	people are much more likely to be subject to this framing. The control
	groups had the largest differences between the positive and negative
	frames, whereas the counter-framing groups had the least amount of
	discrepancy. Druckman recognizes that this may be a result of experimental
	design, but also believes that these results should be of concern.
	In my opinion, there are many things that can be affected by these
	results if they are taken beyond the experimental setting. For one
	thing, it helps to support the idea that anything can be proved by
	statistics, regardless of the actually validity. By changing the
	wording of issues, it can skew data so that real public opinion is
	no longer represented. At the same time, this could have implications
	for elections. In terms of candidate support, the way that candidates
	are portrayed could play a big role in their appeal. By using the
	negative frame of opponent views, it may be possible to sway voters.
	At the same time, issues on the ballot, if written differently, may
	have the ability to sway voters. Even when voters think they know
	what they want, they may be “tricked” into voting otherwise due to
	issue framing. },
  abstract = {One of the most contested questions in the social sciences is whether
	people behave rationally. A large body of work assumes that individuals
	do in fact make rational economic, political, and social decisions.
	Yet hundreds of experiments suggest that this is not the case. Framing
	effects constitute one of the most stunning and influential demonstrations
	of irrationality. The effects not only challenge the foundational
	assumptions of much of the social sciences (e.g., the existence of
	coherent preferences or stable attitudes), but also lead many scholars
	to adopt alternative approaches (e.g., prospect theory). Surprisingly,
	virtually no work has sought to specify the political conditions
	under which framing effects occur. I fill this gap by offering a
	theory and experimental test. I show how contextual forces (e.g.,
	elite competition, deliberation) and individual attributes (e.g.,
	expertise) affect the success of framing. The results provide insight
	into when rationality assumptions apply and, also, have broad implications
	for political psychology and experimental methods.},

	I employ a bivariate probit model with sample selection to test whether
	large war chests deter high-or low-quality challengers from entering
	a race. Once previously omitted variables are included, I find that

	to the American political system. By primarily treating trust as
	a dependent variable, however, scholars have systematically underestimated
	its relevance. This study establishes the importance of trust by
	demonstrating that it is simultaneously related to measures of both
	specific and diffuse support. In fact, trust's effect on feelings
	about the incumbent president, a measure of specific support, is
	even stronger than the reverse. This provides a fundamentally different
	understanding of the importance of declining political trust in recent
	years. Rather than simply a reflection of dissatisfaction with political
	leaders, declining trust is a powerful cause of this dissatisfaction.
	Low trust helps create a political environment in which it is more
	difficult for leaders to succeed.}

  pages = {99-112},

  abstract = {To date, little is known about the precise impact of racially coded
	words and phrases. Instead, most of what we know about racialized
	messages comes from studies that focus on pictorial racial cues (for
	example, the infamous "Willie Horton" ad) or on messages with an
	extensive textual narrative that is laced with implicit racial cues.
	Because in a "post-Horton" era strategic use of racially coded words
	will often be far more subtle than those explored in past studies,
	we investigate the power of a single phrase believed by many to carry
	strong racial connotations: "inner city." We do so by embedding an
	experiment in a national survey of whites, where a random half of
	respondents was asked whether they support spending money for prisons
	(versus antipoverty programs) to lock up "violent criminals," while
	the other half was asked about "violent inner city criminals." Consistent
	with the literature on issue framing, we find that whites' racial
	attitudes (for example, racial stereotypes) were much more important
	in shaping preferences for punitive policies when they receive the
	racially coded, "inner city" question. Our results demonstrate how
	easy it is to continue "playing the race card" in the post-Willie
	Horton era, as well as some of the limits of such framing effects
	among whites with more positive racial attitudes.},

	have an impact on subsequent issue attitudes. To the extent that
	citizens exhibit intransitive value choices and/or apparent difficulties
	in the "translation process" from value preferences to issue attitudes,
	it is due more to low levels of political sophistication than to

  abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive
	model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative
	model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit
	several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets
	of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that
	are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained
	with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes
	to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking
	in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard
	components that are shared by all prospects under consideration.
	This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent
	preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms.
	An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned
	to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities
	are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally
	concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper
	for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than
	the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities.
	Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness
	of both insurance and gambling.}

	that corrected correlations among latent satisfaction variables were

	determining boundary variables which influence the direction of the

	news organization, defines and constructs a political issue or public
	controversy. Two experiments examined the effect of news frames on
	tolerance for the Ku Klux Klan. The first presented research participants
	with one of two local news stories about a Klan rally that varied
	by frame: One framed the rally as a free speech issue, and the other
	framed it as a disruption of public order. Participants who viewed
	the free speech story expressed more tolerance for the Klan than
	participants who watched the public order story. Additional data
	indicate that frames affect tolerance by altering the perceived importance
	of public order values. The relative accessibility of free speech
	and public order concepts did not respond to framing. A second experiment
	used a simulated electronic news service to present different frames
	and replicated these findings.}

  abstract = {Method effects often occur when constructs are measured by different
	methods. In traditional multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) models method
	effects are regarded as residuals, which implies a mean method effect
	of zero and no correlation between trait and method effects. Furthermore,
	in some recent MTMM models, traits are modeled to be specific to
	a certain method. However, often we are not interested in a method-specific
	trait but in a trait that is common to all methods. Here we present
	the Method Effect model with common trait factors, which allows modeling
	"common" trait factors and method factors that represent method "effects"
	rather than residuals. The common trait factors are defined as the
	mean of the true-score variables of all variables measuring the same
	trait and the method factors are defined as differences between true-score
	variables and means of true-score variables. Because the model allows
	estimating mean method effects, correlations between method factors,
	and correlations between trait and method factors, new research questions
	may be investigated. The application of the model is demonstrated
	by 2 examples studying the effect of negative, as compared with positive,
	item wording for the measurement of mood states.},

	More specifically, which provisions have how much effect on what
	kinds of people? We have answered these questions with data from
	the Current Population Survey conducted by the Census Bureau in November
	1972. State registration laws reduced turnout in the 1972 presidential
	election by about nine percentage points. The impact of the laws
	was heaviest in the South and on less educated people of both races.
	Early deadlines for registration and limited registration office
	hours were the biggest impediments to turnout. Contrary to expectations,
	changing these requirements would not substantially alter the character
	of the electorate. The voting population would be faintly less affluent
	and educated; the biggest difference would be a matter of one or
	two percentage points. In strictly political terms, the change would
	be even fainter-a gain for the Democrats of less than half a percent.},

	x approach-avoidance) achievement goal frameworks and developed a
	questionnaire to measure four goals (mastery-approach, mastery-avoidance,
	performance-approach, and performance-avoidance goals). This study
	examines the dual meanings of items in 2 x 2 achievement goal questionnaires
	by confirmatory factor analysis with an uncorrelated-trait and uncorrelated-method
	model and multidimensional scaling technique. A total of 2,111 freshmen
	completed the Achievement Goal Questionnaire for General Academics,
	and a total of 1,014 university students in Taiwan provided their
	ratings on the Chinese Achievement Goal Questionnaire for Physical
	Education. Confirmatory factor analysis results show that the uncorrelated-trait
	and uncorrelated-method model is better than the 2 x 2 four-factor
	model, supporting the dual meanings of items. In addition, multidimensional
	scaling results show that items can be plotted on a two-dimensional
	(mastery-performance and approach-avoidance) map, in which four quadrants
	represent one type of goal. The evidence indicates that the items
	in the Chinese Achievement Goal Questionnaire for Physical Education
	have adequate construct validity in their dual meanings derived from
	the combinations of mastery-performance and approach-avoidance dimensions.},
