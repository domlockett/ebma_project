 We extend ensemble Bayesian model averaging (EBMA) for application to
  binary outcomes and illustrate EBMA's ability to aid scholars in the
  social sciences to make more accurate forecasts of future events.
  In essence, EBMA improves prediction by pooling information from
  multiple forecast models to generate ensemble predictions similar to
  a weighted average of component forecasts. The weight assigned to
  each forecast is calibrated via its performance in some training
  period. The aim is not to choose some ``best'' model, but rather to
  incorporate the insights and knowledge implicit in various
  forecasting efforts via statistical postprocessing.  After
  presenting the method, we show that EBMA increases the accuracy of
  out-of-sample forecasts relative to component models in three
  applied examples: predicting the occurrence of insurgencies around
  the Pacific Rim, forecasting vote shares in U.S. presidential
  elections, and predicting the votes of U.S. Supreme Court justices.
